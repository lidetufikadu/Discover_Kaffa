          Clothing for both warm and cold weather is recommended, especially in mountainous areas it can get quite cold in the evenings. Most Ethiopians wear clothing from head to toe to protect from the sun as well. Ethiopians are not strict when it comes to dress, however it is respectful to wear clothing which is not too revealing. It is not well accepted for men to wear shorts. Comfortable walking shoes are a must, especially when trekking but also for long tours around town and other activities. Rain gear is advisable
